OSX-Brushed skin V2.0 for MPlayer
Created by Ryan Northam 6/5/03

Totally recreated using better quality screenshots of Quicktime player and iTunes :)
It is close to pixel perfect now.

I've two versions of the skin, one with the window controls on the left (default os x look), and another with them on the right. Rename one of the 'skin-buttons-left' or 'skin-buttons-right' files to 'skin' to change where your buttons are placed.
