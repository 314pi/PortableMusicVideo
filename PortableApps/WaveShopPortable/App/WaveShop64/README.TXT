*** WaveShop portable 64-bit binary distribution ***

This is the PORTABLE version: it has NO INSTALLER, and doesn't use the
registry. If that sounds scary, you probably want the regular version,
which includes an installer. It's available at the WaveShop website:
http://waveshop.sourceforge.net

This distribution should contain the following files:

CKUpdate.dll
libmad.dll
libmp4ad.dll
libsamplerate-0.dll
libsndfile-1.dll
License.rtf
ReadMe.txt
Reinstall.bat
WaveShop.chm
WaveShop.exe

NOTES:

The source code for this release is available at the WaveShop web site:
http://waveshop.sourceforge.net

The portable version stores all of its settings in an INI file, called
WaveShop.ini, in the same folder as the application. Deleting this INI
file will reset all of WaveShop's settings to default values.
