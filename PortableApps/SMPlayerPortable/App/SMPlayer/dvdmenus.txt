SMPlayer 0.6.7 adds the possibility to display DVD menus.

In order to enable, you need:

* Check the option "Enable DVD menus" in Preferences->Drives.
* Assign the action "Activate option in DVD menus" (Preferences->Keyboard and 
  mouse) to the left mouse button (so you can select the options in the menus 
  with the mouse).

A recent mplayer build with dvdnav support is required.

Note that cache will be automatically DISABLED (dvd menus won't work with it)
so this can affect performance.

WARNING: support for DVD menus is EXPERIMENTAL and NOT complete yet.
Currently mplayer has a lot of issues/limitations when using dvdnav, and it
doesn't make things easy for front-ends, so the support for the DVD menus
in smplayer can't be improved any further for the moment.

Some of the problems I found:

* it seems there's no way to know the current title that it's playing.
  MPlayer prints a line like this "DVDNAV, switched to title: 1" but
  unfortunately the title number that appears there may not match the
  title IDs that mplayer printed before (it may say "switched to title 2"
  but the actual title may be the 12th). As smplayer doesn't know the
  title, restoring the previous position after a mplayer restart is
  impossible.

* if the audio track is changed, when you return to the dvd menu the
  sound may be lost (while printing a lot of error messages "Too many
  video packets in the buffer").

* subtitles may disappear after seeking.
