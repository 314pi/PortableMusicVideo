This document explains how to compile and install SMPlayer.

Compiling SMPlayer should be easy. It only depends on Qt 4.


1) How to make a deb package
2) How to make a rpm package
3) Generic compilation
4) Changing installation path
5) How to compile in Windows


1) How to make a deb package
----------------------------
Be sure you have installed the following packages: libqt4-dev, zlib1g-dev,
fakeroot, build-essential, devscripts, debhelper and g++.

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev zlib1g-dev fakeroot build-essential devscripts debhelper g++

(Packages to compile with Qt5: qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qt5-default qtscript5-dev
qttools5-dev-tools qtbase5-private-dev libqt5webkit5-dev)

Now run ./create_deb.sh


2) How to make a rpm package
----------------------------
Building a rpm package is not easy. Better get a binary package from
this repository:
https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Asmplayerdev&package=smplayer


3) Generic compilation
----------------------
(obsolete)


4) Changing installation path
-----------------------------
By default smplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX and DESTDIR.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr install

That would install smplayer under /usr.

DESTDIR will be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

That would compile smplayer for /usr but in fact it will be installed in
/tmp/usr/


5) How to compile in Windows
----------------------------
