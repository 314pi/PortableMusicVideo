Version 16.6

   SMPlayer's tablet mode as well.

   the computer, while controlling the application in the computer's

   On high DPI (dots per inch) screens SMPlayer looked very tiny. Now
   the interface is automatically scaled so it looks correctly. There
   are also settings in Preferences -> Interface -> High DPI where you
   can adjust manually the scale factor or turn off this feature.
 * Global shortcuts.
   Now it's possible to use the media keys (play/pause, stop, volume+/-,
   etc.) as global shortcuts. That means that those keys will work even
   when SMPlayer is in the background. You can activate this option in
   Preferences -> Keyboard and mouse.

   mouse -> Mouse -> Drag function: seek and volume.
 * A fix for saving bookmarks.
 * The option for streaming sites in Preferences -> Network is
   different now, and allows these values:
     Disabled: support for video sites is turned off
     Auto: enables the internal support for YouTube and uses mpv + youtube-dl
     for the rest of sites
     YouTube: only the internal support for YouTube will be used
     mpv + youtube-dl: uses mpv + youtube-dl for all sites

   outside of the desktop after an auto resize.
 * When adding files to the playlist the first item is moved to its
   correct place in the list.
 * (Experimental) New action to start/stop capturing the playback stream.
   The captured stream will be saved to the folder specified in
   the smplayer.ini option "capture_directory" with the name
   capture_NNNN.dump.
   It only works correctly with mpeg. With other formats the
   dumped stream won't play back.

Version 0.6.3.1 (release for Windows only)

This release includes a fix for an important bug in 0.6.3 which affected
the version for Windows: the video window would be black on the first
video played, or always if the user opened the preferences dialog before
playing a video. In those cases "directx," was used as video driver but
the -colorkey option was not passed to mplayer producing the problem.
Windows Vista probably wasn't affected by this bug, as it uses a
different video driver as default.


Version 0.6.3.

Most important changes since 0.6.2 (see the Changelog for the whole list):

 * Two fixes for Windows Vista. Now IPv4 is used by default (connection to
   networks are faster). And now it really uses "gl:yuv=2:force-pbo:ati-hack" 
   as the default video output driver. Note: this mode could give problems 
   with some graphic cards (specially ATI), if you experience any, try the
   other gl variants, or just directx.
 * (Linux) Added a fix for a black screen problem when using Compiz.
 * Added an option to select the number of threads that mplayer will use for
   decoding (only works for MPEG-1/2 and some H.264 videos).
 * Added the possibility to disable the audio equalizer. Seems to be necessary
   to use the S/PDIF output.
 * Added some options to increase/decrease the speed by 1% and 4%. This allows
   to play 24 fps movies at 25 fps speed and vice versa.
 * Fix: sometimes the playlist is not shown. Added a workaround for the problem.
 * Added some checks to avoid crashes when selecting subtitle tracks.
 * (Windows) Added a new submenu Video->Screen to select the screen which will
   display the video when using directx.
 * The settings in smplayer.ini have been reorganized in several sections. 
   (This also means most of your preferences will be lost and you will have to 
   reconfigure smplayer again).
 * Added an option to mirror the video. And now it's also possible to flip and
   rotate the subtitles along with the image.
 * Added a new shortcut set (sda.keys) which can be loaded in the shortcut 
   editor in preferences.
 * Added two new translations: Arabic and Kurdish.


Version 0.6.2.

Most important changes since 0.6.1:

 * Added an audio equalizer (please read Audio_equalizer.txt).
 * Added a dialog to search and download subtitles from opensubtitles.org
   (See Finding_subtitles.txt).
 * The toolbars can be configured. The user can remove, add or change the
   order of the buttons. Right now it can only be done by editing manually
   the configuration file. A graphical editor will be added in the next
   version. See Configuring_the_toolbars.txt.
 * The single instance port can now be chosen automatically by the application.
 * Possibility to compile a portable version which (by default) won't write 
   anything outside the smplayer's folder. It won't write either anything 
   in the Windows registry. See Portable_Edition.txt for details.
 * Added the Slovenian translation.


Version 0.6.1.

Most important changes since 0.6.0 final:

 * Now compact mode resizes the window, instead of leaving black borders.
 * Added an option in Preferences->Interface which allows the user to select
   his/her preferred GUI. This way it's easier to use the mini GUI, for those
   who prefer a simpler interface with few buttons.
 * One more fix for Qt 4.4. The option FAQ in the Help menu didn't work.
 * (Windows) Fix: zoom didn't work well (black blocks appeared) if using 
   directx.
 * Added the Catalan translation.


Version 0.6.0 final.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc4:

 * (Bugfix) Two mplayer processes were run when opening a file. This could
   even make Aero in Windows Vista to be disabled.
 * Seeking with the time slider works much better.
 * Now it's possible to add directories recursively to the playlist.
 * Added a preferences dialog for the playlist.
 * The right mouse button can be configured.
 * (Linux) File managers should now display an option to enqueue files in
   the smplayer playlist.
 * (Fix) The playlist was shown for a small moment on startup. This caused
   problems if using compiz, as the window might not hide.
 * Fix for Qt 4.4, the logo didn't show.
 * Some translations have been updated (Simplified-Chinese, Italian, 
   Ukrainian, Dutch, French, Romanian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, 
   Spanish and German)
 * Now the file Install.txt contains updated info about how to compile and
   install smplayer.


Version 0.6.0rc4.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc3:

 * (Bugfix) Now DVDs start to play at chapter #1, instead of chapter #2, 
   if using mplayer 1.0rc2 or older.
 * (Fix) A delay could happen on startup if there were non local files in 
   the recent's menu.
 * (Bugfix) When using the command line options -send-action or -actions, 
   some actions like aspect_4:3 didn't work.
 * Initial support for edl files. If a file with the same name of the file 
   to play but with extension .edl (or .EDL) exists, then smplayer will load 
   it automatically. An edl file allows to skip or mute parts of the video.
 * Possibility to automatically get info (length and name) about the files 
   added to the playlist. This option is enabled by defaul on linux and
   disabled on windows (it's slow in this OS).
 * Added in Preferences->General->Video an option to select the default 
   deinterlacer.
 * Added support for the mouse's buttons XButton1 and XButton2.
 * Some new options have been added to the list of available actions for
   mouse buttons.
 * Possibility to merge the 6 seeking buttons in the GUI into only two.
   It would only show the "rewind 10 secs" and "forward 10 secs" buttons. 
   Keeping them pressed for a moment would popup menu with the rest of the 
   buttons. This option is DISABLED by default and currently it can only be 
   enabled at compile time changing the MINI_ARROW_BUTTONS define in 
   src/guiconfig.h before compiling.


Version 0.6.0rc3.

Version 0.6.0rc2.

This version includes some bugfixes.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc1:

 * Fix for relative paths to the mplayer binary. The problem could cause that
   smplayer couldn't play anything if a directory or file named "mplayer"
   existed in the home directory.
 * The option Play -> Repeat has been improved.
 * The selection of chapters in mkv files didn't work well if using a recent
   mplayer from svn. This has been fixed now.
 * (Windows) Bugfix: the buttons to select the font color in
   Preferences->Subtitles->SSA/ASS didn't show the color.
 * (Windows) Now the screensaver should be disabled even if protected by 
   password (tested on Windows XP).
 * (Windows) Bugfix: don't try to convert to 8.3 short names files that
   don't exist. That could cause that URLs were corrupted.
