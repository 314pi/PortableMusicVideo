<div class="intro">Scrubbing or Seeking is the action of moving the mouse pointer right or left so as to adjust the position, speed or direction of playback, listening to the audio at the same time - a convenient way to quickly navigate the waveform to find a particular event of interest.  <p>The term "Scrubbing" comes from the early days of the recording industry and refers to the process of physically rotating tape reels to move the tape past the playhead to locate a specific point in the audio track.</p> 
<p>In Audacity
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Scrubbing</b> changes the audio position without skipping. </li>
<li> <b>Seeking</b> changes the audio position, skipping over audio to move more quickly.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scrubbing">Scrubbing</span></h2>
<p>The primary method for scrubbing is with the <b>Scrub Ruler</b>, the gray strip immediately below the <a href="timeline.html" title="Timeline">Timeline</a>. The Scrub Ruler is set on and displayed by default in Audacity, if you have turned it off you can get it displayed again by right-clicking in the Timeline and selecting <span class="menu">Enable Scrub Ruler</span> from the <a href="timeline.html#menu" title="Timeline">dropdown menu</a>.
</p><p>If you hover the cusor over the Scrub Ruler you will see green left- and right-pointing scrub widget <span title="Green Scrub widget"><img alt="Scrub icon naked 80%.png" src="../m/images/4/43/scrub_icon_naked_80.png" width="15" height="13" /></span> appear <i>(along with a tooltip if you continue to hover)</i>.  Clicking anywhere in the Scrub Ruler and releasing the left mouse button will start Scrubbing from there.   Note that in this image the green scrub widget is to the right of the green triangle playhead, indicating that forwards scrubbing towards the pointer is taking place.   
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Scrub widget and scrub playhead in Scrub Ruler"><img alt="Scrubbing using the Scrub Ruler.png" src="../m/images/6/6e/scrubbing_using_the_scrub_ruler.png" width="689" height="177" /></dd></dl>
<p>On starting scrub by clicking in Scrub Ruler, the green scrub widget <span title="Green Scrub widget"><img alt="Scrub icon naked 80%.png" src="../m/images/4/43/scrub_icon_naked_80.png" width="15" height="13" /></span> will appear in the Scrub Ruler and the green playhead cursor <span title="Green playhead cursor"><img alt="PlaybackCursor.png" src="../m/images/d/d0/playbackcursor.png" width="13" height="10" /></span> will appear in the Timeline.
</p><p>Playback continues until the playhead in the Timeline <span title="Playhead in the Timeline"><img alt="PlaybackCursor.png" src="../m/images/d/d0/playbackcursor.png" width="13" height="10" /></span> reaches the green Scrub widget <span title="Green Scrub widget"><img alt="Scrub icon naked 80%.png" src="../m/images/4/43/scrub_icon_naked_80.png" width="15" height="13" /></span>, and restarts when the pointer is moved again. If you keep moving the pointer slowly, this plays the audio slowly. If you move the pointer a long way from the playhead, this plays at normal (1x) speed.
</p><p>When Scrubbing you can left-click in Scrub Ruler and hold the button down to temporarily change to <a href="#seeking">Seeking</a>. Once you release the mouse button you can move it to resume Scrubbing from the point at which you stopped Seeking.
</p><p>Right-clicking anywhere in Scrub Ruler displays a menu identical to that in <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu_scrubbing.html" title="Transport Menu: Scrubbing">Scrubbing</a></span> where you can quickly start, stop (or change between) Seeking or Scrubbing or turn Scrub Ruler off. Using this menu to change between Seeking and Scrubbing saves you having to move the pointer to Scrub Toolbar and so change the playhead position un-necessarily. Adding and using shortcuts for Scrub and Seek has the same benefit. 
</p>
<ul><li>Once Audacity is in scrub play mode it will remain in that mode until you explicitly stop playback (which then allows you to restart in normal play mode). 
<ul><li> <b>To stop scrub play and set the cursor at the current playback position</b>, click the Stop button <span title="Stop button"><img alt="The Stop button" src="../m/images/f/f9/stop.png" title="The Stop button" width="16" height="16" /></span> <i>(or its shortcut <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #d0d0f8">Space</span>)</i>. It may be useful to <a href="label_tracks.html" title="Label Tracks">label</a> that position for future reference. Alternatively click the Play button <span title="Play button"><img alt="The Play button" src="../m/images/9/90/play.png" title="The Play button" width="16" height="16" /></span> to restart normal playback immediately from the current playback position. These methods remove any selection that was present before stopping scrub play. </li>
<li> <b>To stop scrub play, leaving the selection or editing cursor where it is</b>, use the Escape <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">Esc</span> key. </li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>The speed of scrub can be controlled by rotating the mouse wheel <i>(if your mouse is so equipped)</i>. Each four steps upwards of the rotated wheel doubles the speed, and each four steps downwards halves the speed. This is equivalent to one octave of pitch change. The changed scrub speed will be shown for a few seconds in ochre text superimposed on the track. Changed speeds set by the mouse wheel are not remembered if you stop playback and restart Scrubbing.</li></ul>
<div class="note">On MacOS Lion and later, the default scroll direction is reversed, so that moving up with the mouse wheel or Track Pad reduces scrub speed and moving down increases speed. You can change the scroll direction in the System Preferences.</div>
<ul><li> You can zoom at the mouse pointer position while Scrubbing or Seeking by holding the <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">Ctrl</span> key <i>(<span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">&#8984;</span> on Mac)</i> down and rotating the mouse wheel, or by using the zoom buttons in <a href="edit_toolbar.html" title="Edit Toolbar">Edit Toolbar</a> or their shortcuts, or by using the <a href="view_menu.html" title="View Menu">View Menu</a> zoom commands.</li></ul>
<ul><li> For safety reasons, you cannot start Scrubbing or Seeking while recording (or paused in recording mode).</li></ul>
<div id="seeking"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Seeking">Seeking</span></h2>
<p>Seeking is similar to Scrubbing except that it is playback with skips, similar to using the seek button on a CD player. Even if you move the mouse pointer a long way from the current position of the playhead, the playhead will immediately move very close to the mouse pointer, letting you move across the audio rapidly. 
</p><p>Seeking with unpinned playhead is always at 1x speed. You can control the maximum seek speed with by mouse position and mouse wheel when you are in <a href="#pinned">pinned playhead</a> mode.
</p><p>To enter Seeking or change from Scrubbing to Seeking, click the Seek button <span title="Seek button"><img alt="Seek Button 60%.png" src="../m/images/a/a1/seek_button_60.png" width="18" height="18" /></span> in <a href="scrub_toolbar.html" title="Scrub Toolbar">Scrub Toolbar</a> <span title="Scrub Toolbar"><img alt="Scrub Toolbar 60%.png" src="../m/images/c/c3/scrub_toolbar_60.png" width="58" height="20" /></span>.  Alternatively you can use the <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu_scrubbing.html" title="Transport Menu: Scrubbing">Scrubbing</a></span> menu item and select <span class="menu">Seek</span> from the cascading menu, or set a shortcut for Seek in <a href="keyboard_preferences.html" title="Keyboard Preferences">Keyboard Preferences</a>.      
</p><p>When Seeking, the Seek widget <span title="Green Seek widget"><img alt="Seek icon naked 80%.png" src="../m/images/9/97/seek_icon_naked_80.png" width="21" height="13" /></span> will appear in the Scrub Ruler (or in the Timeline if the Scrub Ruler is not displayed). There is no need to drag the widget when in Seek - moving the pointer seeks in the same way as drag. 
</p>
<div class="note">While Scrubbing or Seeking, you can still click in the track to set the editing cursor, or click and drag to make a <a href="audacity_selection.html" title="Audacity Selection">selection</a>. The point or region could then be <a href="label_tracks.html" title="Label Tracks">labelled</a>. For example, let the playhead reach the mouse pointer at the start of a region of interest. Then drag a selection which will play, stop dragging and release the mouse when you hear the end of the region you want, then label the selection.</div>
<div id="pinned"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pinned_playhead_Scrubbing_and_Seeking">Pinned playhead Scrubbing and Seeking</span></h2>
<p>If you use Scrubbing or Seeking with the playhead <a href="playing_and_recording.html#pinned" title="Playing and Recording">pinned</a> in the center of the project window, so that playback constantly scrolls the track, the speed of scrub or seek playback behaves differently to when the playhead is unpinned.
</p><p>In pinned playhead mode the mouse pointer position always directly determines the speed of scrub or seek. The further away you move the mouse pointer from the Timeline playhead (in either direction), the faster the scrub or seek. The current scrub or seek speed is shown permanently in lime green text, superimposed on the track.  The default maximum scrub speed is +1.00 (for forwards play) and -1.00 (for backwards play), that is normal speed. The default maximum seek speed is +10.00 (for forwards play) and -10.00 (for backwards play).
</p><p>The speed of scrolling scrub or seek as determined by the mouse position can be varied by rotating the mouse wheel (if your mouse is so equipped). Move the wheel upwards to increase the speed or downwards to reduce the speed. This works at the same time as modifying the speed by moving the pointer left or right. The maximum possible speed with the pointer at either edge of the window and the wheel at maximum speed is 32.00x for Seeking and 320.00x for Scrubbing. Changed speeds set by the mouse wheel are not remembered if you stop playback and restart Seeking.
</p>
<div class="example">A very useful setting for using scrubbing with pinned playhead is to move the pointer to the extreme right (100%) position and increase the maximum speed to 2.00x.<p> With this setting, when you move the pointer back to the 75% position on the waveform you will get normal speed forwards  playback and at 25% position you will get normal speed backwards playback.  Moving the pointer towards the center from there will give you gradually slower than normal speed and moving towards the right or left edges will give you gradually faster than normal speed up to your chosen maximum of 2.00x.</p>
<p><span title="Forwards scrubbing at 1.00x speed at 75% position, 2.00x maximum speed"><img alt="Pinned x2 Scrubbing at x1 speed.png" src="../m/images/f/fa/pinned_x2_scrubbing_at_x1_speed.png" width="689" height="163" /></span>
