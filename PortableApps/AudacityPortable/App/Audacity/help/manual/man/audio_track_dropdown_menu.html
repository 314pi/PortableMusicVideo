<p>This first half of this <i><a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">waveform</a></i> is a <a href="generate_menu.html#chirp" title="Generate Menu">"Chirp"</a> tone which stays at the same <i><b><a href="glossary.html#amplitude" title="Glossary">amplitude</a></b></i> (loudness), as shown by the horizontal top and bottom. The <i><b><a href="glossary.html#linear" title="Glossary">linear</a></b></i> scale on the left goes from +1 at the top (the maximum possible loudness without distortion when the signal is positive) to -1 at the bottom (the maximum when it is negative). The horizontal line centered on 0.0 is silence. What you cannot see without <a href="zooming.html" title="Zooming">zooming</a> much further in is that the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#pitch" title="Glossary">pitch</a></b></i> of this tone is gradually increasing. Zooming would show the individual <i><b><a href="glossary.html#cycle" title="Glossary">cycles</a></b></i> in the waveform (the positive and negative peaks) occurring much closer together at the end of the sound. The second half of the waveform is the word "Audacity" spoken by a male voice. 
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;"><span title="Zoomed-in view of a Chirp tone"><img alt="SndChirp.png" src="../m/images/d/d2/sndchirp.png" width="620" height="150" /></span></div> 
<p>This image is a waveform view of an extremely short chirp, one tenth of a second, with only a few cycles, where the pitch increases very rapidly. As it's so short, we can zoom in to show the closer spacing of the cycles as the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#frequency" title="Glossary">frequency</a></b></i> (and hence the pitch) increases from left to right.
</p>

<p>This is the same chirp and word as in the first <a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">Waveform</a> image, but in this view the vertical scale is in <i><b><a href="glossary.html#decibel" title="Glossary">dB</a></b></i>. This is a <i><b><a href="glossary.html#log" title="Glossary">logarithmic</a></b></i> method of displaying the amplitude.

<p>This view of the same chirp and word shows how the amount of energy in different frequency bands changes over time. Higher frequencies are at the top of the scale, lower frequencies at the bottom. The blue color is the least energy and the red and white are the most. The progressive increase of pitch in the chirp tone is vividly demonstrated by the upward sloping diagonal line. Spectrogram view also confirms that the "Audacity" word has most energy in the middle of the word.

<ul><li> Go to the <a href="spectrograms_preferences.html" title="Spectrograms Preferences">Spectrograms Preferences</a> to see the options for adjusting exactly how the spectrum is displayed and for the various styles of spectrogram display. </li>
<li>You can click in the <a href="audio_tracks.html#scale" title="Audio Tracks">Vertical Scale</a> at any time to zoom in to a particular frequency range, or right-click to zoom out. Frequencies higher than half the sample rate of the track are not displayed because a given rate cannot contain higher frequencies than that.</li>

<p>These are the same settings that you find in <a href="spectrograms_preferences.html" title="Spectrograms Preferences">Spectrograms Preferences</a> but changes you make in Spectrogram Settings  affect just the particular track on which you open the settings, and persist only while that track is open in the project. For details see <a href="spectrogram_view.html#Per_track_Spectrogram_Settings" title="Spectrogram View">Per track Spectrogram Settings</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Splitting_and_Joining_Channels">Splitting and Joining Channels</span></h2>
<p>The Track ControlPanel Menu varies slightly bewtwen stereo and mono tracks.  For a stereo track you only see commands applicable to a stereo track and similarly for a mono track.  The image at the top of this page is of a stereo track.
</p>
<div id="mono"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mono_Tracks">Mono Tracks</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Make Stereo Track</b> Use this command on the upper of two adjacent, single channel tracks which you want to join into one stereo track. The upper track always becomes the left channel of the new stereo pair and the lower the right channel, irrespective of whether each was mono, left or right before joining to stereo.  </li></ul>
<div class="note">See <b><a href="splitting_and_joining_stereo_tracks.html" title="Splitting and Joining Stereo Tracks">Splitting and Joining Stereo Tracks</a></b> for more details on using the <i><b>Split Stereo Track</b></i>, <i><b>Split Stereo to Mono</b></i> and <i><b>Make Stereo Tracks</b></i> commands. </div> 
<div id="stereo"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stereo_Tracks">Stereo Tracks</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Swap Stereo Channels</b> Use this command on a stereo track to swap the left and right channels without having to split the stereo track (see below). The left channel and the right channel and will change places, so that the audible content of the left channel moves into the right and the audible content of the right channel  moves into the left.  </li>
<li> <b>Split Stereo Track</b> splits the two channels of a stereo pair into separately editable tracks for left and right channels, left above the right. If you are mixing multiple single channel files, you might want to use the "Split Stereo to Mono" command noted below then use the pan slider on the <a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Track Control Panel.</a> This will give you more control over the pan than leaving  the tracks as left and right channel.</li>
<li> <b>Split Stereo to Mono</b> splits the two channels of a stereo pair into two separately editable mono tracks.</li></ul>
<div id="colors"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wave_Color">Wave Color</span></h2>
<p>Selects from one of four <i><b><a href="audio_tracks.html#colors" title="Audio Tracks">colorways</a></b></i> to be used for the waveform in the track.
</p>
<div id="format"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Format">Format</span></h2>
<p>Converts the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#sample_format" title="Glossary">sample format</a></b></i> of the current track state to 16-bit integer PCM, 24-bit integer PCM or 32-bit floating point. The number of computer <i>bits</i> representing each sample in the waveform will be recalculated for the changed <a href="digital_audio.html#Sample_formats" title="Digital Audio">precision</a>. Further edits will be performed at the new bit depth, but audio data for any track states before the conversion remains at its previous bit depth. This means that <a href="undo_redo_and_history.html" title="Undo, Redo and History">undoing</a> the format change is always lossless.   
</p>
<div id="rate"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rate">Rate</span></h2>
<p>Change the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#sample_rate" title="Glossary">sample rate</a></b></i> of the track, which can be thought of as the concentration of audio <i><b><a href="glossary.html#sample" title="Glossary">samples</a></b></i> in the track or the time distance between them. Increasing the rate squeezes the existing samples into a shorter length (so increasing playback speed and pitch), while decreasing the rate spreads them out over a greater length (so reducing playback speed and pitch). This is useful for example if you import a file that has the wrong rate and thus plays at the wrong speed. 
</p><p>Changing the sample rate of a track without changing the speed involves <i><b><a href="glossary.html#resampling" title="Glossary">resampling</a></b></i>. Resampling for <a href="file_export_dialog.html" title="File Export Dialog">export</a> is always done by changing the <i>Project Rate</i> in <a href="selection_toolbar.html" title="Selection Toolbar">Selection Toolbar</a>. To resample a track for use in the project, choose <a href="tracks_menu.html#resample" title="Tracks Menu">Resample</a> in the <a href="tracks_menu.html" title="Tracks Menu">Tracks Menu</a>.
